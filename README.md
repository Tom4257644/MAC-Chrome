<h1>Mental Arithmetic Challenge - A Google Chrome Extension</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project was a fun game I made to practice my personal mental arithmetic and potentially make something educational that people online might find useful. This project was made as a Google Chrome Extension and is currently live on the Chrome Store here: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mental-arithmetic-challen/kkfijllpelljnmcfgebmopacpakpaknb?authuser=0&hl=en
